/*********************Exercise 2********************
 * Floow teh HelloDate.java example in this
 * chapter to create a "hello, world" program that
 * siply displays that statement. You need only  a
 * single method in your class(the "main" one that
 * executes when the program starts) Remember
 * to make ti static and to include the argument
 * list(even though you don't use it).
 * compile the program with javac and run it using
 * java. If you are using a different development
 * environment than the JDK, learn how to compile
 * and  run programs in that environment
