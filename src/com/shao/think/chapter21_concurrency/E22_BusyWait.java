 * Create an example of a busy wait. One task
 * sleeps for a while and then sets a flag to
 * true. The second task watches that flag inside
 * a while loop( this is the busy wait) and when
 * the flag becomes true, sets it back to false
 * and reports the change to the console. Note how
 * much wasted time the program spends inside the busy
 * wait, and create a second version of the program
 * that uses wait() instead of the busy wait.
