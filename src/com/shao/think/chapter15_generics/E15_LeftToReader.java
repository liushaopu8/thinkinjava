/*************** Exercise 15 *******************
 * "Notice that f() returns a parameterized
 * TwoTuple object, while f2() returns an
 * unparameterized TwoTuple object. The compiler
 * doesn't warn about f2() in this case because
 * the return value is not being used in a parameterized
 * fashion; in a sense, it is being "upcast" to an
 * unparameterized TwoTuple. However, if you were to
 * try to capture the result of f2() into a parameterized
 * TwoTuple, the compiler would issue a warning."
 *
 * Verify the previous statement
